[Project README](../README.md) · [中文 README](../README.zh-CN.md)

## 1. Startup and deployment

- Requirements: Python 3.8+, standard library only.
- Start: `python run.py --port 5088 --rds http://<rds-host>:8088`, then open <http://127.0.0.1:5088> in a browser.
  - Options: `--port`, `--host` (default 127.0.0.1), `--rds/--base` dispatcher URL, `--data DIR` data directory (default: the project directory, or the environment variable `ORDER_TESTER_DATA`), `--adapter` (default `rds`).
  - Data directory contents: `settings.json` (with a `servers` list and `currentServerId`; only `lang` is global), `drafts.json` / `scene_cache.json` / `sent_orders.json` (bucketed by server id), `templates/` (shared library; **which template is active** is per server), `logs/`, `maps/`.
- Windows: double-click `start_tester.bat` (runs in the background with `pythonw` and opens the browser; if `pythonw.exe` is not on PATH, set the environment variable `PYW`).
- The dispatcher address saved in the page (written to `settings.json`) takes precedence over the `--rds` startup option.
- Updating a deployment: replace the program files (back them up first) → stop the old `run.py --port 5088` process → start it again in the background with `pythonw run.py --port 5088` → open the home page and confirm it returns 200. The data directory (templates, station pools, orders) is not affected.
- Self-test: `python -m unittest -v`; `tools/fake_rds.py` is a fake RDS (`--port`, `--scene-delay SECONDS` simulates a slow scene, `--scene-fail` simulates a failure).

## 2. Config & Dispatch (配置与派单) — four sub-tabs

The sub-tabs at the top switch between pages; the current sub-tab is remembered in the browser's localStorage. Every sub-tab shows a persistent **summary** line at the top: current template · number of stations in each pool in use · strategy · planned order count (format: `Template {tpl} · {pools} · {strat} · {n} orders planned`), with a **Generate orders** (生成运单) button next to it (the same button as on the 4th sub-tab).

### 2.1 Connection (连接)
- **Global left server list**: a shared rail on the left of every main tab (Config & Dispatch / Map / Robots / Test Orders); the **app title** (Order Dispatch Tester) sits at the top of that same left rail (same width as the server list), with a vertical divider separating it from the tab bar and main content on the right. Each entry is an independent parameter set (URL, adapter, station pools, active template, dispatch options, M4 auth/scene, etc.). Click a row to switch the active server; the content of the current tab reloads for that server's parameters. Save writes to the **currently selected** server only and does not clobber others.
  - **Add / Rename / Delete**: delete asks for confirmation; at least one server must remain. A new server requires a non-empty name and starts with empty defaults (empty URL / pools / test orders & drafts; fill the URL then save), and is seeded with the built-in `default` order template as the active template; `sent_orders.json` is bucketed per server so switching or adding never mixes orders. Switching servers clears the robots list and map cache until the new adapter returns data.
  - **Collapse / expand**: the « / » chevron on the left rail edge collapses the list to a thin strip to reclaim horizontal space; when expanded, behavior is the same as before. Collapsed state is stored in the browser's localStorage (`odtSrvCollapsed`) and survives a reload.
- On Config & Dispatch (right side): Dispatcher URL, Poll interval (s), Stuck threshold (s), Vehicle idle threshold (s), Dispatcher adapter. Language is switched from the top-right control (Chinese/English) and is **global** (not per server).
- **Dispatcher** (调度系统): `RDS` (default) or `M4`. Switching takes effect immediately and is saved under the **current server** in `settings.json`. Choosing RDS or M4 shows the matching options (M4 reveals auth and scene for the **current server**; there is no multi-profile UI — connection is per left-sidebar server). See "M4 dispatcher" below.
- A legacy flat `settings.json` is migrated once on startup into a `servers` list (backup: `settings.pre_server.json`); previous values land under one entry named from the old URL host.

### 2.2 Pools (站点池)
- **Load stations from scene** (从调度系统场景加载站点): **the only manual entry point for loading the scene**. In one go it pulls the stations, pre-points, robot groups, scene geometry (routes tessellated by curve type) and point cloud from the active dispatcher (RDS: `/scene` `normalPosList`, `/downloadScene` when needed; M4: `normalPosList` in the scene schema, else `GET /api/fleet/scenes/{sceneId}/download/{mapFile}` from `groupsMap.mapFile`), and it always fetches afresh; the Map tab reuses the result directly (see section 7).
- The station table is read-only: it can be searched and filtered by type, shows positions and pre-points, and lists only stations already in a pool (see "Station list on the Pools tab (read-only)" below). Stations can be added to a pool in only two ways: click a station on the **Map** tab, or use **Paste stations manually** (comma/newline separated station names).
- **Station pools**: the defaults are `start` and `end`. You can create any pool (letters/digits/underscore, not starting with a digit) with **New pool**, **Rename** it (custom pools; references in templates are updated accordingly), **Delete pool**, **Swap** two pools, and click × to remove a single station. Pools the current template does not use are marked "(not used by the template)".
- **"In use" pools** only look at **enabled** steps: the pools used by enabled `Pool` steps, and the pools that enabled `Pre-point of step` steps finally point to (following the reference chain). A pool referenced only by disabled steps (for example `start` in a "drop-only" template where the pick and pre-point Wait steps are both disabled and only the drop is kept) does not count as in use: it is not shown in the summary, generating/auto dispatch does not require it to be non-empty, and the order's Stations column shows only the end station (with `pickPre` empty). The empty-pool validation (frontend and backend) applies only to pools in use.
- **Strategy** (生成策略): Random (no reuse) (随机不重复; default count = size of the first pool), Round-robin (轮询; order i takes the i-th station of each pool, count = largest pool), Cartesian product (全组合).
- Options: "No repeated station within an order"; "Avoid reusing stations within a batch (sampling without replacement)".

### 2.3 Template (订单模板)
- **Two-pane layout**: left is the template list (click to switch the active template) with bottom buttons New / Copy / Delete / Import / Export (files are in `<data>/templates/*.json`); right is the current template content.
- **Template name** is editable on the right (renames and persists on change; must be a valid name). **Description** (`#tpl_title`) remains editable.
- **Action mode (per step)**: next to **Operation** in the step table, a dropdown `binTask` | `operation` (shared by M4 and RDS; mix freely in one template). `binTask` = action name only, no args (args column hidden); `operation` = name + args. New steps default to `binTask`. There is no global "step action field" switch.
- The step table lets you add (**+ Add step**), delete, enable/disable, and reorder steps (buttons or **Drag to reorder**); the **delete control is in the first column** with the drag handle / up-down buttons. You can switch to **Raw JSON mode**; below is a collapsible **Sample order preview (dispatcher JSON)** (the JSON the dispatcher actually receives). See section 3 for the fields.
- The **variableShape column is shown only for RDS** (hidden for M4, header and cells); switching the dispatcher refreshes visibility.
Step columns: location → **Mode** → **Action** (single input) → **Args** (operation only; hidden for binTask).

### 2.4 Dispatch & Generate (派单参数与生成)
- **Robot group** (机器人组; RDS `group`; if none is chosen the field is omitted), **Vehicle** (指定车辆; empty = auto assign), **Priority** (优先级), **label (optional)**.
- **Block-by-block** (逐块下发; off by default) and **Block poll (s)** (逐块轮询(秒); default 1): see "Block-by-block dispatch" below. The checkbox state is saved with the configuration and applies to later clicks of **Send selected** and to auto dispatch.
- **Manual pre-point map** (前置点手动映射): one `station=pre-point` per line; for several values per station write `station=pre-point1|pre-point2` (the first is the default). It takes precedence over scene derivation; `station:pre-point` and `station pre-point` are also accepted, and anything after `#` is a comment. Invalid syntax (for example `AP1=LM1, LM2`, `AP1=`, or the same station on two lines) is marked red below the input box, and generation fails with an error that names the line number.
- **Orders N** (订单数 N; tick "=default" to follow the strategy default) → **Generate orders**: this only generates drafts ("Draft"); send them later from the Test Orders tab.
- If the template uses pre-points but the scene has not been loaded yet, the scene is loaded automatically before generating (with an overlay; a failure shows a dialog); stations without a pre-point are reported and skipped.

## 3. Order template fields

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| On (启用) | Disabled steps generate no block |
| ID | **Required**; unique within the template, must not be empty or duplicated; used for variable references. Default block/step suffix is `-<ID>` (UI edits only ID; if an old template still has `blockSuffix`, generation still honors it) |
| Note (说明; step `name`) | Optional display text (may be Chinese); may be empty — save/validate do not require it. Distinct from the template-level Description (`title`) |
| Location (位置来源) `location` | `Pool` (站点池; `{"type":"pool","pool":"<pool name>"}`, picks a station from the pool according to the strategy; the dropdown lists all pools); `Pre-point of step` (另一步骤站点的前置点; `{"type":"pre","step":"<step ID>"}`, looks up the manual map first, then derives AP→LM from the scene); `Fixed station` (固定站点; `{"type":"fixed","station":"<station>"}`) |
| Pre-point selection `select` / `selArg` | `pre` steps only. Which candidate to use when the station has several candidate pre-points; see "Multiple pre-points" below |
| Operation (动作) `operation` | For example `JackLoad`, `JackUnload`, `ForkLoad`, `Wait`, `Script`; `none` means move only |
| Action mode `opMode` (动作模式) | `binTask` (name only) or `operation` (name + args); shared by M4/RDS; mix per step. New steps default to `binTask`. If omitted: M4 falls back to profile/`binTask`, RDS falls back to `operation` (legacy templates) |
| Args (JSON) (参数 args) | Must be a JSON object; multi-line edit box, its height can be dragged vertically. Hidden and ignored when `opMode=binTask` |
| variableShape | Column shown for RDS only; optional; after ticking "on" enter `head` / `tail` (numbers, in meters), which are written to the block's `variableShape`. Hidden when Dispatcher is M4 |

**args variables** (substituted inside strings; an unknown variable is an error):
`{start}` `{end}` `{<pool>}` the station picked from that pool for this order; `{pickPre}` `{dropPre}` the pre-points of the start/end stations; `{pre:<pool>}` the pre-point of that pool's station; `{stationOf:<step ID|stepN>}` the station of a step; `{preOf:<step>}` the pre-point of a step's station; `{orderId}` the order ID.

### Multiple pre-points (pre-point selection strategy)

When the scene is loaded, **all** candidate pre-points of each station are stored (including direction, distance and whether it is an LM, kept in the scene cache) and listed by number below the station table's "Pre-point" column, for example `1.LM1(in 1.0m) 2.LM2(in 3.0m) 3.LM3(out 2.0m)`. Candidate order: the one specified in the station's properties → in and LM → out and LM → other in → other out; within a group, nearest first. The first one is the default pre-point (same as before).

`pre` steps get an extra selector under "Location" (`location.select` / `location.selArg` in the template JSON):

| Strategy | select / selArg | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| nearest (default) | omitted, or `nearest` | The 1st candidate; with a manual mapping, the first manual value. Old templates are unaffected |
| by number | `index` / `2` | The N-th candidate (starting from 1) |
| by name / wildcard | `name` / `LM1*` | The first candidate whose name equals or matches the wildcard (`*`, `?`) |
| by direction | `dir` / `in` or `out` | The first candidate with direction in / out |
| random per order | `random` | One candidate chosen at random for each order |

- With a manual mapping, the candidate list = the manually written values (in the order written; direction/distance are taken from the scene information; a point that is not in the scene has an unknown direction, so selecting by direction will not match it).
- Variables can also carry a strategy, written after `@`: `{preOf:<step>@in}`, `{preOf:<step>@out}`, `{preOf:<step>@#2}`, `{pre:<pool>@name=LM1*}`, `{preOf:<step>@random}`; without `@` they behave as before.
- Within one order, the same station + the same strategy is chosen only once (also for random), so steps and variables get the same result.
- When nothing matches, generation fails with an error naming the step, station, strategy and all candidates, for example: `no pre-point matches dir=out for station AP2 [step pre] (candidates: LM20(in))`.
- The pre-point actually chosen is recorded for each order (`preChosen` in the order record); when the Test Orders tab's Stations column shows ⓟ, hover over it to see "step: station → pre-point (strategy)".
- Example: `examples/templates/pre_select_demo.json`.

The built-in `default` template = the original five-block RDS deadlock test order (pre-point Wait → pick → Script → drop → fork lift). On first install it is created only when no templates exist yet. **Adding a server** also writes `default` under that server's `templates/<serverId>/` and sets it active; if the user later deletes every template, the empty list is left alone (no re-seed).

## Map tab

- Layers (**Point cloud**, **Routes**, **Stations**, **Vehicles**): next to Point cloud you can choose the point size thin / medium / bold / extra bold (screen pixels, unchanged when zooming); the choice is saved (settings + browser).
- The **Station heading** layer: stations that have an angle in the scene get a purple heading arrow (RDS field `dir`, in radians; `angle`/`theta`/`yaw` are also recognized); stations without an angle are not drawn; stations with `ignoreDir=true` ("ignoreDir: any heading") get a light-colored arrow; hovering over a station shows its name, type and angle (degrees). Angles are saved with the scene cache.
- Point cloud and routes both come from the scene load (see section 7); the Map tab **no longer offers** manual **Upload .smap** or a local path. Both RDS and M4 pull the scene map from the connected dispatcher. The Map tab itself does not trigger a scene load.
- With the Stations layer on, station names are drawn; LM and AP are both clickable into pools (same for M4 and RDS). M4 routes are tessellated from the scene curve type (Straight / Bezier / DegenerateBezier / NURBS / Arc, etc.), not drawn as straight endpoint links.

## 4. Robots

- Robot groups are parsed from `/scene` when the scene is loaded; the **Robot group** dropdown in Dispatch parameters comes from here.
- The Robots tab shows robots partitioned by group (those without a group go under "Ungrouped"), with columns: Position, Station, Order, Order state, Dispatchable, Connected, Blocked, Battery, Idle; a robot that has an order and has been idle longer than the "Vehicle idle threshold (s)" is marked red (suspected deadlock).

## 5. Test Orders tab

- **Grouping**: the Drafts group is pinned at the top; sent orders are grouped by Batch (newest batch first); the group header shows the batch time, order count, per-state counts, stuck count and total duration; groups can be collapsed, and **Select this group (filtered)** is available. Orders sent by older versions are assigned to "Legacy batch" groups inferred from the log or from time gaps.
- **Sending**: tick drafts → set **Interval (s)** for this batch and **Max open orders** (0 = unlimited) → **Send selected**; you can also **Stop sending**, **Delete selected drafts**, and **⇄ Swap start/end of selected drafts** (rebuilt with the current template).
- **Sent**: **Cancel selected**, **Cancel all open test orders** (terminate), **Clear sent list** (drafts are kept), and view the JSON (**View** in the JSON column).
- **Filter**: State (multi-select; none checked = all), Vehicle contains, robot group, Stations (matches "start→end"), Order ID, **Stuck only**, **Hide finished**, **Clear filter**; shows "{n}/{total} match".
- Vehicle and robot-group filters apply to sent orders only; drafts with no assigned vehicle/group stay visible.
- **Sorting**: click a column header to toggle ascending/descending (Order ID, Stations, Vehicle, State, Created, Age, Unchanged, Started/Ended, Duration, etc.); the sort setting is remembered in localStorage.

## 6. States and stuck detection

- States: Draft, SENT, CREATED, TOBEDISPATCHED, RUNNING, WAITING, FAILED, FINISHED, STOPPED, SEND_FAIL, etc.
- Terminal states (polling stops): FINISHED, STOPPED, MANUAL_FINISHED, CANCELED/CANCELLED, SKIPPED (and SEND_FAIL when sending failed). **FAILED is not terminal** (RDS can recover); monitoring continues and the order can be judged stuck.
- **Possibly stuck**: the order is not finished, **has a vehicle assigned**, and its "Unchanged" duration > the stuck threshold. A change in state/block state, or vehicle movement > 5 cm or rotation > 2°, counts as a change; orders without an assigned vehicle are not counted. The stuck count is shown on the tab, in group headers and in the map summary.

## 7. Scene loading and the overlay

- **Entry points for loading**:
  - Manual: only **Load stations from scene** on the Pools tab (stations + pre-points + robot groups + geometry + point cloud loaded together, ignoring the cache and fetching afresh).
  - **Scene cache**: after every successful load, the server keeps the scene (stations, pre-points, robot groups, routes, point cloud) in memory and persists it to `<data>/scene_cache.json` (including the load time), so it survives a service restart. A failed load does not overwrite the last successful cache.
  - When the page is opened/refreshed, it **unconditionally restores from the cache**, without contacting RDS and without showing the overlay; the station area and the map tab's status line show "Scene loaded at HH:MM" (with the date if not today).
  - Only clicking **Load stations from scene** fetches from RDS again and updates the cache; Generate orders prefers the cached pre-points.
  - With no cache: if the pools are non-empty when the page opens, the scene is loaded automatically once; if Generate orders needs pre-points and the scene has not been loaded, it is loaded automatically.
  - The Map tab **no longer has** a "reload scene/point cloud" button and never triggers a load itself; when no scene is loaded, its status line tells you to go to the Pools tab to load it ("Scene not loaded: go to Config & Dispatch → Pools and click "Load stations from dispatcher scene""). Point cloud and routes come only from that Pools-tab scene load (no manual `.smap` upload/path).
- **Overlay and progress bar**: while loading, a full-screen translucent overlay + spinner + "Loading scene… (/scene can take 30-60 s)" is shown, with a progress bar, the current stage and the elapsed seconds ("{s} s elapsed") below it (Chinese/English); clicks and keyboard input are blocked, and it disappears automatically when done.
  - Stages: "Requesting /scene, waiting for the dispatcher…" (waiting for the response; the bar scrolls) → "Downloading scene" (with Content-Length it shows a percentage and downloaded/total size; without it, it shows downloaded KB/MB and the bar scrolls) → "Parsing stations / routes" → "Parsing point cloud" → "Writing cache".
  - When `/scene` contains no point cloud (`normalPosList`), the point cloud is taken from the map, adding these stages: "Downloading map (/downloadScene)" (also with a percentage or MB) → "Unpacking / parsing map" → "Downsampling point cloud" (shows the raw point count); when the map has not changed it shows "Map unchanged, reusing point cloud cache" and skips parsing and downsampling.
  - **The point cloud cache is content-based**: `pointcloud_cache.json` is keyed by the hash of the map file content; when the map downloaded from /downloadScene has the same content as last time, the file in `maps/` is not overwritten and the cache is reused directly; it is re-parsed only when the content changed. When `/scene` routes are already available, parsing the map only extracts the point cloud and does not recompute the routes.
  - The server runs the load as a background job (`/api/scene_geom?async=1` starts it, `/api/scene_job?id=` queries progress), and the page queries every 0.3 seconds; multiple simultaneous loads share one job. All load entry points go through this job.
- **Failure messages**:
  - A failure of a manual load or a load triggered by generating: a dialog reports the error, and the station area shows the error and a **Retry** button.
  - A failure of the automatic load at page open: **no dialog**, the error is only shown in the station area.
  - The server treats a non-2xx HTTP status from `/scene`, a network error, a non-JSON-object response or a parse exception as a failure (it is never treated as a successful load with 0 stations).
- **Browser cache**: pages and static assets are served with `Cache-Control: no-store`, and `app.js` carries a version number `?v=<modification time>`, so a refresh after deployment takes effect immediately.
- **Version and build date**: a fixed bottom-left footer shows `vX.Y.Z · YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC` (from `GET /api/version`; `BUILD_DATE` is UTC when the version file was written). It stays visible with the sidebar open/collapsed and on map-fill, and does not intercept clicks.

### Station heading: automatic backfill of old caches
Stations in an old `scene_cache.json` have no `dir`. When the cache is restored at startup, if no station has an angle, a background task parses `dir`/`ignoreDir` from the local smap (the smapPath in the settings, or the map auto-downloaded under `maps\`), adds them to the cache and writes it back, without downloading the map again. It is logged as `dir_backfill`. If there is no local smap, just load the scene once more (the unit of the `dir` field from /scene is radians).

### Display of multiple pre-points
When a station has several direct LM routes, all of those LMs are candidates (for example AP100 → LM101 / LM102).
- The default pre-point (the first in the candidate list, i.e. the nearest "in" LM) is shown in bold in the pre-point info line; the other candidates follow it, joined with `/`, in gray.
- On the map, the dashed line of the default candidate is darker and those of the other candidates are lighter.
- When there is at least one LM candidate, non-LM neighbors (for example AP200 on an AP-AP link) are no longer counted as candidates, so that index and random never pick an AP.

### Station list on the Pools tab (read-only)
The list shows only stations that have been added to some pool, and no longer lists all the stations in the scene.
- Columns: Station, Type, Position, Pre-point (the default pre-point in bold, followed by the candidate list), Pools (colored tags; a station can belong to several pools).
- The Search box and Type filter only filter among these selected stations.
- The list itself cannot add stations. There are only two ways to add stations:
  - click a station on the **Map** tab;
  - use **Paste stations manually**.
- To remove a station, click the × on its tag in the pool.
- When the list is empty, a hint about the ways above is shown ("No station is in any pool yet. Add stations by clicking them on the Map tab or via "Paste stations manually".").

### Orders cancelled in RDS
- Polling keeps tracking a FAILED order (FAILED is not terminal and can still recover in RDS) until it enters a real terminal state.
- Terminal states include: FINISHED, STOPPED, MANUAL_FINISHED, CANCELED/CANCELLED, WITHDRAWN, TERMINATED. After entering a terminal state:
  - the duration is frozen and the end time is recorded;
  - it is no longer counted as stuck;
  - it is counted under that state in the statistics;
  - you can tick CANCELED/STOPPED in the State filter to pick out such orders.
- For an order cancelled (withdrawn) in the RDS UI, RDS deletes the record outright: `/orderDetails/<id>` returns `{"code":50002,"msg":"order details is empty"}`.
  - After the tool receives "order not found" 3 times in a row, it records the order as **CANCELED (gone from RDS)**, displayed in purple. The end time is the moment of the first failed lookup, and the log records `order_change gone=true`.
  - A network error or timeout alone does not lead to this judgment.
  - If the order can be found again in between, the counter is reset and tracking continues with the actual state returned by RDS.
- The tool only uses read-only GET requests to query order state and never sends any write operation to RDS.

### Block-by-block dispatch (逐块下发; block-by-block)
- When off (the default), behavior is exactly as before: `POST /setOrder` carries all blocks at once, with `complete: true`.
- When ticked, each order is tracked independently (the multiple orders of a batch/auto dispatch can proceed at the same time):
  1. `POST /setOrder`: carries only the first block, `complete: false`.
  2. The tool polls `GET /orderDetails/<id>` at the **Block poll (s)** interval, and when the `state` of the last sent block is `FINISHED`, it does `POST /addBlocks` with body `{"id": <order ID>, "blocks": [next block], "complete": false}`.
  3. Right after the last block has been appended successfully, `POST /markComplete` with body `{"id": <order ID>}` (seal the order).
  - Success criterion: HTTP 200 and a returned `{"code": 0}`; after 5 consecutive failures of addBlocks/markComplete, the tool stops.
- Stop conditions: **appending never stops as long as the order has not reached a terminal state**. It stops only when the order `state` is `FINISHED` / `STOPPED` (cancelling in the tool = RDS terminate → STOPPED; also CANCELED/WITHDRAWN/TERMINATED/SKIPPED), and the reason is written to the log (`inc_stopped`). Order or block `FAILED` / `Error`, `SUSPENDED`, `WAITING`, unknown states, an orderDetails request that fails/times out/finds no such order, and consecutive addBlocks failures all only log a warning (`inc_warn`), pause and keep polling; once things recover, appending continues (in real tests RDS briefly reports an order as FAILED and then recovers to RUNNING).
- Entries of block-by-block orders (saved in sent_orders.json) that older versions marked "stopped" because of `order FAILED` / `order Error` / order not found / repeated addBlocks failures are automatically restored to appending at startup or at the next poll (log `inc_revived`), and continue from the blocks already present in orderDetails without appending duplicates.
- The State column of the Test Orders tab is followed by a `blocks k/N` tag: blue = appending ("appending blocks"), green ✓ = all appended and sealed ("all blocks appended, marked complete"), orange = order/block abnormal, paused until recovery, still polling ("order/block abnormal, paused until recovery (still polling)"), red = order terminal (FINISHED/STOPPED), stopped ("order terminal (FINISHED/STOPPED), appending stopped"; hover for details). The status line at the top shows "{n} block-by-block orders open".
- An unsealed order's state in RDS after all blocks are finished is `WAITING` (not FINISHED); it becomes FINISHED only after it is sealed.
- Tool restart: the appending progress is saved in `sent_orders.json`, and tracking resumes automatically after startup (log `inc_resume`; the tag's hover text shows "resumed after tool restart"). On resume, the block list returned by orderDetails is authoritative, and blocks already in RDS are not appended again.
- Log events: `inc_start`, `inc_add`, `inc_resync`, `inc_error`, `inc_done`, `inc_stopped`.
- Checked against the official RDSCore HTTP API documentation (sections "Orders" / "Action blocks"):
  - `setOrder`'s `complete` (bool, false = do not seal; `addBlocks` can follow); `addBlocks` body `{id, blocks, complete?}` (`complete` needs ≥0.1.8.22090102; this tool does not use it for sealing); `markComplete` body `{id}` (`{idList}` is also supported; this tool does not use it).
  - Success criterion: HTTP 200 and `code` equal to 0 **or absent**; error codes 40000/50000/50001/50002/50003 (addBlocks on a sealed order returns 50003 "order is complete").
  - Order states: CREATED / WAITING / RUNNING / SUSPENDED / FINISHED / FAILED / STOPPED / Error / TOBEDISPATCHED; action block states additionally include POSTING and MANUAL_FINISHED.
  - Block-by-block appending: the next block is appended only when the previous block is `FINISHED` or `MANUAL_FINISHED` (manually finished); when a **block** is `FAILED` / `STOPPED` / `Error`, only a warning is logged (the tag turns orange, "order/block abnormal, paused until recovery") and polling continues, and appending resumes after the block recovers and reaches `FINISHED`/`MANUAL_FINISHED`; an **order** that is `FAILED` / `Error` likewise only pauses (orange tag); appending stops only when the order `state` is a terminal `FINISHED` / `STOPPED` (or cancelled). SUSPENDED, WAITING, POSTING and unknown states only wait and do not stop.
  - Note: by default RDS allows addBlocks on a non-existent order ID to **create the order automatically** (parameter CreateNewOrderWhileAddBlocks), so before every append the tool first confirms with orderDetails that the order still exists; if the order is not found, it stops and does not append any more.

## M4 dispatcher (M4 调度系统)

The tool can also drive an M4 fleet server instead of RDS. RDS stays the default; nothing changes for RDS users.

### Setup
1. On **Config & Dispatch → Connection**, set **Dispatcher** (调度系统) to `M4`. The **M4 connection** (M4 连接) box appears; the top **Dispatcher URL** is that M4's `http://<m4-host>:<port>` (ask the M4 administrator for the port). M4 connection is **per left-sidebar server** (no multi-profile picker inside one server).
2. Fill in the fields for the current server (including the URL):
   - **Scene** (场景): the M4 scene orders are created in. Click **Test connection** (测试连接), then pick one from the dropdown shown as **name（ID）** (no manual ID entry).
   - **Auth** (认证): choose one — **App ID / App key** (应用 ID / 密钥; machine clients from M4 proxy users, headers `xyy-app-id` / `xyy-app-key`) or **Username / password** (用户名 / 密码; `POST /api/sign-in` session cookie, re-sign-in after 401). Only the fields for the chosen mode are shown.
   - **App ID** (应用 ID), **App key** (应用密钥), **Username** (用户名), **Password** (密码) — only the fields for the chosen auth mode are shown.
3. Click **Save** (保存) to write both the top settings and the current server's M4 connection (edits also auto-save).
4. **Action mode** is chosen **per step** on **Template** (订单模板) (no global "step action field" on the right). `binTask` sends `rbkArgs: {"binTask": <operation>}` (no ordinary args); `operation` sends `rbkArgs: {"operation": <operation>, ...args}`. Script steps always use `operation: "Script"`. A leftover stored `opMode` is only a default fallback; the UI no longer edits it.

The app key and password are stored only in the local, gitignored `settings.json`. They are masked as `******` in the UI, in `/api/settings` and `/api/m4`, and they never appear in the logs. Leaving `******` in a field keeps the stored value. As an alternative, the environment variables `ODT_M4_APP_ID`, `ODT_M4_APP_KEY`, `ODT_M4_USER`, `ODT_M4_PASSWORD` and `ODT_M4_SCENE` fill in any field that is empty in the connection.

### Per-step hints (template step `args` / `opMode`)
- Step field `opMode`: `"binTask"` or `"operation"` (primary; shared by M4 and RDS).
- These keys are read by the M4 adapter and are not sent inside `rbkArgs`:
  - `m4Mode` (legacy): `"binTask"` or `"operation"`; migrated into `opMode` on validate, then optional cleanup.
  - `m4BinTask`: the bin task name to send instead of the operation name, e.g. `"Load"`.
  - `forLoad` / `forUnload`: by default a step whose operation contains "unload" gets `forUnload: true`, one containing "load" gets `forLoad: true`, and other steps get both false. Set them explicitly to override.

### How the M4 adapter maps things
- RDS order = M4 transport order; RDS block = M4 step (step `id` = order ID + block suffix, same as the RDS blockId); RDS `complete` = M4 `stepFixed`.
- Normal send: `POST /api/fleet/orders/create` with all steps and `stepFixed: true`. **Vehicle** (指定车辆) and **Robot group** (机器人组) become `expectedRobotNames` / `expectedRobotGroups`, and **label (optional)** (label(可选)) becomes `externalId`.
- **Block-by-block** (逐块下发): create with only the first step and `stepFixed: false`, then `POST /api/fleet/orders/add-steps` for each next step once the previous step is `Done`, then `POST /api/fleet/orders/complete-order` to seal the order.
- Status is polled with `GET /api/fleet/orders/query-order-detail` at **Poll interval (s)** and **Block poll (s)**, the same as RDS (no callbacks). States are shown in the tool's RDS-style names:

| M4 | Shown as | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Done | FINISHED | terminal, appending stops |
| Cancelled | STOPPED | terminal, appending stops |
| any status with `fault: true` | FAILED | pause only (warning), keep polling and appending |
| ToBeAllocated / Allocated / Executing | TOBEDISPATCHED / CREATED / RUNNING | normal |
| Pending | WAITING if not sealed, otherwise RUNNING | normal |
| Cancelling, Withdrawing, unknown | as reported, upper case | not terminal, keep polling |

  Query errors (HTTP errors, 401/403, timeouts) and add-steps/complete-order errors only pause, exactly like RDS. Only Done and Cancelled stop appending.
- Robots: `GET /api/fleet/robots/all-all?sceneId=`. Stations and map: `GET /api/fleet/scenes/schema/{sceneId}`, using `structure.areas[].mergedMap` (points, paths, bins, point cloud `normalPosList` when present). Unknown fields are ignored. The Map tab loads every point (including LM); a station's pre-point is still the nearest connected `LM`; routes are tessellated from `className`/`curveType` plus control points; the point cloud comes from `normalPosList` in the schema when present, otherwise from each area's `groupsMap.*.mapFile` downloaded via `GET /api/fleet/scenes/{sceneId}/download/{mapFile}` (same URL the M4 UI uses; `.smap` parsed like RDS `/downloadScene`, same downsample/cache). Not from station coordinates.
- **Cancel selected** (取消选中订单) and **Cancel all open test orders** (取消全部未完成测试订单) use `POST /api/fleet/orders/cancel {sceneId, orderId}`.

### Testing without a real M4
`python tools/fake_m4.py --port 18090` starts a mock M4 server with mock data (scene `scene-1`, app ID/key `mock-app`/`mock-key`, login `mockuser`/`mockpass`). Order IDs containing `fault` report a fault for a while and then recover, `qerr` makes the order query fail for a while, and `xcancel` gets cancelled in M4 after the first step.

On startup, `default` is created only when the template store is empty; renaming it away will not recreate it.
Map label **Select:** is a dropdown of **station pool names** (click a station to add it to that pool).
Map tab fills the viewport (no page scrollbars); the canvas resizes with the window.
